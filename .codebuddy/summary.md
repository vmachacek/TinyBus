# Project Summary

## Overview
This project is primarily developed using C# and is structured around the .NET framework. The project appears to be a bus implementation, possibly for event handling or messaging within applications, as suggested by the name "TinyBus". The project includes a generator component, indicating that it may have features for code generation or configuration.

## Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Language**: C#
- **Framework**: .NET
- **Main Libraries**: Specific libraries are not listed in the provided file structure, but typical libraries for .NET projects may include those for unit testing, logging, and dependency injection.
